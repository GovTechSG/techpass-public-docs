# Reset multifactor authentication (MFA)

TechPass users need to reset MFA if they:

- Change their mobile phone.
- Delete Authenticator app from their mobile phone.

Users whose TechPass domain is ```techpass.gov.sg```, will only have TechPass profile(account) and must [Reset TechPass MFA](reset-techpass-mfa-for-new-device) when needed.

Users whose TechPass domain is not ```techpass.gov.sg``` will have two profiles(accounts) - SGGovt M365(WOG) and TechPass. Such users need do the following:

- [Reset WOG(SGGovt M365) MFA](reset-security-verification-for-wog-account).

- [Create service request](https://go.gov.sg/techpass-sr) to remove the MFA of their TechPass profile.

- When the request is processed successfully, you will be able to register a new TechPass MFA profile when you try to sign in again.

> If you have changed your mobile phone, use your new device to complete these steps.
