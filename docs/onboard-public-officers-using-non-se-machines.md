  Public officers need to set up security verification(multi-factor authentication) for their Whole-of-Government(WOG) account to access Singapore Government Technology Stack (SGTS) services and tools from their GMD device.

  If you do not have a GMD or do not intend to access SGTS services using GMD, skip this step and proceed to **Onboard to TechPass**.

  2. Select **Mobile app** as the preferred authenticating method, and we strongly recommend you to choose **Receive notifications for verification**.
