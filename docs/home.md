## What is TechPass
TechPass is an Identity & Access Management (IAM) and Single Sign On (SSO) Solution for services within the Singapore Government Technology Stack (SGTS).
It is built to provide users with a seamless login experience across SG TechStack services and allow access control to be managed easily from a centralised location.

## Key Concepts
TechPass is powered by [Microsoft Azure AD service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/). 
It builds on top of Azure AD to cater to the specific requirements of the public service's development environment. 
TechPass empowers engineering teams working on SGTS products to develop and rollout their services quickly by simplifying the amount of work needed to implement a new service.

TechPass utilises popular open standards such as, [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) / [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/) (OpenID Connect) 
and [SAML 2.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.html) (Security Assertion Markup Language), 
for authentication and authorization.

OAuth 2.0 SSO setup is available on TechPass Portal while SAML service is available only by request.
Please reach to us [here](support/overview?id=need-more-help) if you need SAML support for your product and services.

## TechPass Portal
We provide a [self-service portal](https://portal.techpass.gov.sg) to facilitate any setting up of SSO for SG-TechStack products and IAM management of your users.

?> This self-service portal is accessible only via non SE-GSIB devices.

You may access this [user guide](https://docs.developer.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/#/) to learn more about setting up SSO or manage your users.

?> You will need sign up for a TechPass account in order to view the user guide
