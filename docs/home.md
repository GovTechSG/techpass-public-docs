## What is TechPass
TechPass is an Identity & Access Management (IAM) and Single Sign On (SSO) Solution for services within the Singapore Government Technology Stack (SGTS).
It provides a seamless login experience across SG TechStack services and allows to easily manage access control for users from a centralised location.

## Key concepts
TechPass is powered by [Microsoft Azure AD service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/). It is built on top of Azure AD to meet specific requirements of public service's development environment.

TechPass allows engineering teams working on SGTS products to develop and roll out their services quickly by simplifying the process needed to implement a new service.

TechPass utilises popular open standards such as, [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) / [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/) (OpenID Connect)
and [SAML 2.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.html) (Security Assertion Markup Language),
for authentication and authorisation.

OAuth 2.0 SSO setup is available on TechPass Portal while SAML service is available only by request.
Please reach to us [here](support/overview?id=need-more-help) if you need SAML support for your product and services.

## TechPass portal
You can access [TechPass portal](https://portal.techpass.gov.sg) only from non-SE GSIB devices.  This portal allows you to set up SSO for SG TechStack products and manage IAM for your users.

Refer to [TechPass Tenant user guide](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-tenant-guide/#/) to learn more about setting up SSO and manage your users.
