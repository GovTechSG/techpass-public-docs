If you have a new mobile device, you'll need to set it up to work with multi-factor verification. This is a multi-step solution.-->

1. Go to [My Account](https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/proofup.aspx?proofup=1).

2. If prompted, sign in to your TechPass account and go to **Security info**. When prompted to approve the sign-in, use your old mobile device to approve.

?> If you are a public officer and trying to access your TechPass account from an internet Government Managed Device(GMD), you will be prompted to authenticate your SG GovtM365 account before authenticating TechPass sign-in.
