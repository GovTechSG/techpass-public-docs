# Request for SEED and submit Intune device ID for SEED onboarding

This article is applicable only for public officers who have an existing active TechPass ID and need to onboard their device to SEED. Public officers can request for SEED from the [TechPass portal](https://portal.techpass.gov.sg/public/home) using their non-SE GSIB machine.

>**Notes**:
>- You can't onboard a GSIB or DWP device to SEED.
>- If you are a vendor or contractor, contact your project manager or reporting officer to request for SEED provisioning before proceeding with your SEED onboarding.

 It may take up to 30 minutes for Intune to update your device with the required softwares and configurations. Until this is completed, the device onboarding status is **Pending**. Once the device is updated with all the required softwares and configurations, the SEED onboarding status changes to **Onboarded** and you will receive a successfully onboarded email.
