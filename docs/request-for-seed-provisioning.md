?>- If you have already been provisioned with SEED, instead of **Request for SEED**, you will see two buttons displayed: **Onboard device to SEED** and **I don't need SEED**.<br> - If you will only be accessing GCC/SGTS services on GSIB, SEED is not required. You may click **I don't need SEED** to have your SEED deprovisioned.<br> - Otherwise, you may click **Onboard device to SEED**. Before you proceed to onboard your Internet Device to SEED, see [SEED documentation](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/prerequisites-for-onboarding).
