# Reset security verification for Whole of Government (WOG) account

Public officers may have to reset security verification for their WOG account in the following cases:

- Changed the mobile device which was used to set security verification for their WOG account
- Accidentally deleted the Authenticator app from their mobile device.

 ?> In case of lost the mobile device, public officers need to get in touch with their respective Agency Facility Management(AFM) team. If public officers are transferred to a different agency, they can sign up for a new TechPass account while the old account will be terminated by the previous agency.

The following instructions guide you to reset your WOG account security verification.

_To reset security verification for WOG account:_

3. After it is removed, go to your Authenticator app on your old mobile phone or device and remove the existing MFA of your WOG account(SG GovtM365).

?> This only removes the MFA profile for the WOG account in that device.

4. Select **Authenticator app or Token** and click **Set up Authenticator app**.
