If you are public officer and want to get a TechPass account, refer to [Create TechPass Account](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-documentation/#/onboard?id=public-officer)

If you are a vendor, request the engaging agency or ministry to provide you with a TechPass account. For more information, refer to [Vendor onboarding to TechPass](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-documentation/#/onboard?id=vendor).

**TechPass ID**
This is used to log in to your TechPass account.

- For public officers, it is your WOG ID.
- For vendors, it is *your_name<span>@</span>techpass.gov.sg*.

**Whole of Government(WOG) ID or account**

WOG ID is the email address belonging to the gov.sg domain. For example, *your_name<span>@</span>tech.gov.sg* or *your_name<span>@</span>mof.gov.sg*.

Public officers who onboard to SEED must have a WOG ID or account. Note WOG ID and official email address are used interchangeably.
