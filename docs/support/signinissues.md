# TechPass onboarding and signing in FAQs

<details><summary>Can I use my <em>your_name<span>@</span>litemail.gov.sg</em> to sign up for a TechPass account?</summary>

No. As LiteMail accounts can't receive emails outside your agency, you will not receive emails from TechPass. So upgrade to a standard mailbox before signing up for TechPass. Format of a standard, organisational email address of a public officer is *your_name<span>@</span>agency.gov.sg*.

<details><summary>I am using a SE GSIB device. How do I sign up for a TechPass account?</summary>

If you are using a SE GSIB device:

1. Create a [service request](https://go.gov.sg/seed-techpass-support) to get your TechPass account.

2. In **Ticket Request Type**, select **Service Request** and choose **Create TechPass account for Secured Email GSIB users**.
3. When prompted to confirm, if you are a Secured Email (SE) GSIB user, select **Yes**.

> **Note**:
> It takes 3 business days for us to provision a TechPass account for a SE GSIB user. For more information on SE-GSIB device, refer to the [Glossary](glossary).

<details><summary>How do I confirm if my device is SE GSIB or non-SE GSIB device?</summary>


If you are using a SE GSIB device, you need to use your PS-Card to authenticate. If you are using a non-SE GSIB device, every time you log in to your device, you need to enter your BitLocker PIN.
